Between my foot trying to kill me(lots of pain and crutches between Christmas and early January is fun), Exams and the flu I've had very little time to blog, let alone work since my last post. I did manage to fix the payments log and some other small things in that time however. Now that I'm well-ish again(here's hoping!) it's back to work.
