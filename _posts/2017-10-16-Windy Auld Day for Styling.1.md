There's a little old thing called storm Ophelia trying to blow ireland away as I type this but it'll be grand sure. Since the last post I've been watching video's on Dynamics CRM, marking drafts for the web project and trying to figure out what the T-SQL project even is. The storm put paid to any meeting with Codec-dss today but I've at least made this blog look a wee bit more snazzy.
