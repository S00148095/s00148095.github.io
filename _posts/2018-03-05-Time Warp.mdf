Apologies for not posting for a month. What has happened in that time you ask? Honestly its been a hectic blur. Weekly or bi-weekly assignments in database combined with considerable time inputted into the codec project has seen time disappear into the void. I couldn't give you a detailed breakdown of of what we've done off the top of my head if I tried but we're powering through requirements and look on course to deliver a good project. Oh and there are reports to write, so I'll stop talking and go write those.
