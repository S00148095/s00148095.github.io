For a large amount of the last week the dynamics 365 instance was obstructed by a sql server error. For fairly obvious reasons that prevented considerable work on that project, however considerable progress was made on other fronts. RAD, Prof Dev and TSQl done or nearly done, and good progress towards completion on web.
