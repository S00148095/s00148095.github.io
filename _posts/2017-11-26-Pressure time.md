With deadlines rapidly approaching this week was a hive of activity. In web getting data back from the API was a priority and was sorted out to a decent extent. Some manipulation and  more GET requests remain. In RAD it was more a cas eof putting in the time with the assignment due next friday. Thankfully all bar part 4 is complete with 5 days to spare. In codec we have torn into work like hungry dogs, configuring the CRM to fit our spec. We discovered we did not have access to the portal however. Tick tock.
