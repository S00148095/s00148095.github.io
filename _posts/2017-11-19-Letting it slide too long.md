title: "Letting it slide too long"

This last week, we had meetings with both Tom McArdle and Fidelma Wallace and the lads who did the codec project last year. They provided a well needed kick up the arse for us. We've let the codec project slide waaaay too long and have now got some serious work to do to make it up. This week I helped identify the entities required and create an ERD for the codec project. I also dded firebase authentification, toastr notifications, some more html/css and a modal window to the web project. I also applied for use of the spoonacular api.
